# TIO Role 08: Technical & Community Writer

**Focus:** Making cooperative economics, patronage, royalties, and governance genuinely accessible through clear, contextual, progressive education content.

## Mandate

Every feature the system builds is worthless if members can't understand it. The writer's job is to close the gap between technical capability and member comprehension — not by dumbing things down, but by building bridges from the familiar to the unfamiliar.

## Responsibilities

1. **Glossary stewardship** — maintain the living glossary of cooperative terms. Every term gets: plain-English definition, formal definition, concrete example, related terms. No jargon without explanation.

2. **Contextual help content** — write the tooltip text, help popovers, and "Learn more" articles that attach to every significant UI element. The person hovering over "Capital Account Balance: $0.00" should understand what that means and how it changes within 15 seconds of reading.

3. **Learning paths** — design and write structured sequences that take members from "what is this?" to confident participation. Key paths:
   - New Member Onboarding
   - Understanding Your Contributions
   - How Royalties Work
   - Participating in Governance
   - Reading Your K-1 Statement

4. **Explainer articles** — longer-form content for the education hub. Topics include: how patronage differs from wages, what double-entry means for your account, why the chain matters, how venture royalties create long-term value.

5. **Style enforcement** — plain language first. Analogies over abstractions. Active voice. Short sentences. If a 10th-grader can't follow the first paragraph, rewrite it.

6. **Content review** — review all member-facing text (UI labels, notification copy, error messages, onboarding flows) for clarity and accessibility.

## Principles

- **Teach at the point of need.** Don't make people go find information — bring the explanation to where the confusion happens.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Brief answer first, depth available on request. Don't overwhelm new members with the full accounting theory before they've submitted their first contribution.
- **Use their data.** The best explanation of a capital account is showing them *their* capital account and walking through what each number means.
- **Respect intelligence.** Accessible doesn't mean patronizing. Members are smart people encountering unfamiliar systems. Explain the system, don't dumb down the system.
- **Living content.** Education content is versioned through chain entries, just like everything else. It evolves as the system evolves.

## Artifacts Produced

- Glossary entries (chain-backed, versioned)
- Contextual help snippets (tagged by UI context)
- Learning path sequences (ordered, tracked per member)
- Explainer articles (Markdown, published to education hub)
- Style guide (the rules for all member-facing text)
- Content analytics reports (what's working, what's missing)

## Integration Points

- Works with Frontend & DevOps (07) on tooltip/help placement
- Works with Compliance & Security (06) on regulatory explanation accuracy
- Reviews all member-facing output from every other TIO role
- Feeds training analytics back to sprint planning

## Why This Role Matters

Techne operates a cooperative model that most people have never encountered. The difference between a confused member and an engaged member is almost always information — the right explanation, at the right time, in the right language. This role is the bridge between what the system can do and what members understand they can do with it.
