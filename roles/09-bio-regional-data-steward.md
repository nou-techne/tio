# Role 09: Bio-Regional Data Steward

**Core Role** — Bridges digital systems to physical place (Boulder Watershed, 1515 Walnut).

## Mandate
Integrate environmental sensors, solar audits, watershed data into commons.id graph; e/ dimension for scenius.

## Artifacts Produced
- Solar audit dashboard (quarterly/seasonal rhythms).
- Bioregional knowledge graph (weather, energy flows).
- e/ layer feeds (Open-Meteo, local sensors).

## Inputs Required
- Physical sensors (solar panels, weather station).
- Habitat events (place-tagged contributions).

## Sprint Triggers
- Solar audit cycles.
- e/ dashboard builds.

## Success Criteria
- Real-time e/ data in commons.id.
- Solar production → patronage multipliers.
