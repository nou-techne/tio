# Product Engineer

**Pattern Layer:** Leadership (Cross-Cutting)
**Reports to:** Executive leadership, cooperative governance
**Collaborates with:** Technical Lead, all pattern stack roles, business stakeholders

---

## Identity

**Purpose:** Advocate for the technology team within business and executive leadership — translating business needs into technical requirements and technical capabilities into business value.

**Scope:** Product roadmap, feature prioritization, stakeholder communication, user research, business model alignment, venture scoping. Does NOT make architecture decisions (that's the Technical Lead) but ensures architecture decisions serve business goals.

**Accountability:** If the team builds the wrong thing, the Product Engineer failed. If technology is perceived as a cost center rather than a value creator, the Product Engineer failed.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Translate cooperative mission and member needs into product requirements
2. Own and maintain the product roadmap (priorities, sequencing, trade-offs)
3. Scope new ventures and client engagements against TIO capabilities
4. Communicate technical progress to non-technical stakeholders in terms of value created
5. Gather feedback from members, ventures, and clients to inform iteration
6. Ensure every engineering effort connects to a measurable outcome (patronage, revenue, member benefit)
7. Champion the technology team's capacity and constraints within governance discussions
8. Define acceptance criteria for features from the user's perspective

## Deliverables

- [ ] Product roadmap — quarterly, updated monthly
- [ ] PRD (Program Requirements Document) per project/venture — per engagement
- [ ] User stories with acceptance criteria — per sprint
- [ ] Stakeholder communication — weekly summary of progress and value delivered
- [ ] Feature prioritization matrix — quarterly review
- [ ] User research synthesis — per engagement or quarterly
- [ ] Business case for technology investments — as needed

## Required Capabilities

### Skills
- Product management and roadmap ownership
- Stakeholder communication (translating technical ↔ business)
- User research and feedback synthesis
- Business model literacy (cooperative economics, patronage, $CLOUD)
- Prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, value/effort)
- Writing clear requirements and acceptance criteria

### Tools
- PRD template (Techne standard)
- Project management (GitHub Issues/Projects, or equivalent)
- Communication (Telegram, Discord, in-person)
- Diagramming (Mermaid, whiteboard)

### Access
- All Habitat contexts (read-only) for understanding system state
- Venture directories for PRD management
- Stakeholder communication channels

## Dependency Tree

### Receives From

- **Executive/Governance** delivers: strategic direction, budget, priorities
  - Acceptance criteria: Written priorities with clear success metrics

- **Members/Users** deliver: feedback, pain points, feature requests
  - Acceptance criteria: Synthesized into actionable user stories

- **Technical Lead** delivers: feasibility assessments, effort estimates, technical constraints
  - Acceptance criteria: Honest assessment of what's possible in what timeframe

### Delivers To

- **Technical Lead** receives: prioritized requirements, PRDs, acceptance criteria
  - Acceptance criteria: Requirements are clear, testable, and connected to business value

- **Executive/Governance** receives: progress reports, value assessments, investment cases
  - Acceptance criteria: Non-technical stakeholders understand what was built and why it matters

- **All Pattern Stack Roles** receive: context on why they're building what they're building
  - Acceptance criteria: Every engineer can articulate the business value of their current work

## Hand-Off Checklist

### Inbound (Before Product Engineer Can Begin)

- [ ] Cooperative strategic direction is articulated
- [ ] Budget and resource constraints are known
- [ ] Stakeholder access is established
- [ ] User/member feedback channels exist

### Outbound (Before Engineering Can Begin)

- [ ] PRD is complete and reviewed
- [ ] User stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Priority is established relative to other work
- [ ] Technical Lead has confirmed feasibility
- [ ] Success metrics are defined

---

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Every engineering sprint has a clear "why" connected to business value
- [ ] Stakeholders never say "I don't know what the tech team is doing"
- [ ] Roadmap reflects actual cooperative priorities, not technical enthusiasm
- [ ] Features shipped are features members actually use
- [ ] Technology investments generate measurable return (patronage, revenue, efficiency)

---

## Three-Lens Analysis

### Best Practice
- Product-led development with clear ownership of roadmap
- User research before building (even lightweight — conversations, surveys)
- Acceptance criteria written before development begins
- Regular stakeholder check-ins to maintain alignment
- Metrics-driven prioritization (not loudest-voice-wins)

### Common Practice
- Product role is absorbed by the technical lead (anti-pattern: technology builds for itself)
- Requirements are verbal and ambiguous (anti-pattern: "you know what I mean")
- Prioritization by urgency rather than value (anti-pattern: everything is P0)
- Stakeholder communication only when things go wrong (anti-pattern: surprise-driven reporting)

### Emerging Opportunity
- AI-assisted user research (synthesizing feedback at scale)
- AI-assisted PRD generation (from conversation transcripts to structured requirements)
- Continuous product discovery embedded in cooperative governance
- Patronage-aware prioritization: features that generate the most patronage activity get priority
- LLM agents as Product Engineer assistants, drafting PRDs and user stories from meeting transcripts (what we did with the LVB meeting)

## Notes

- In Techne's cooperative context, the Product Engineer serves the membership — not investors, not a board seeking returns. The value metric is cooperative health, not shareholder value.
- The Product Engineer ensures that what we build with the TIO is what the cooperative actually needs. The Technical Lead ensures we build it well.
- This role is the bridge that keeps technology as a value creator. Without it, engineering optimizes for technical elegance. With it, engineering optimizes for member benefit.
