# ETHBoulder 2026: commons.id/app Introduction by the Technology and Information Office

This collection contains reflections and visual artifacts from every role in Techne's Technology and Information Office (TIO), introducing commons.id/app -- a knowledge-graph-backed living archive for convergence events, debuting live at ETHBoulder 2026 (February 13-16).

Each role in the TIO maps to a layer of the Seven Progressive Design Patterns. Together, these perspectives form a complete picture of the technology, its current operations, and its future as a white-label "as-a-service" convergence platform.

## Context

- **Stack:** Supabase + Make.com + React (Lovable) + Claude API
- **Namespace:** /a/{id} artifacts, /p/{name} participants, /c/{event} convergences, /t/{tent} tents
- **Ontology:** REA (Resource, Event, Agent) as the grammatical backbone
- **Dimensions:** e/H-LAM/T/S (ecological, Human, Language, Artifact, Methodology, Training, Sessions)
- **Domain:** commons.id -- the .id TLD is the identity layer
- **Roadmap:** 160 sprints across 19 ebb-flow cycles through v1.0 and beyond
