# Product Engineer -- Reflections on commons.id/app

**Role:** Product Engineer | **Layer:** Leadership (Cross-Cutting)

## What We Built and Why It Matters

My job is to ensure technology serves people rather than the other way around. With commons.id/app, the central product question was deceptively simple: what happens to all the knowledge generated at a convergence event like ETHBoulder? The talks, the hallway conversations, the whiteboard sketches, the commitments made over coffee -- where does that go after the weekend ends?

The answer, historically, is that it dissipates. Scattered across Discord servers, forgotten notebooks, and half-remembered introductions. commons.id/app exists because that loss is unacceptable.

The product thesis is straightforward: give participants a single place to contribute raw knowledge -- text, observations, notes -- and let the system extract structured artifacts with relationships, dimensions, and attribution. The knowledge graph that emerges is not a static archive. It is a living representation of what a community knows, organized along seven dimensions (e/H-LAM/T/S) that capture the full spectrum of convergence activity.

## What Excites Me About the Roadmap

Three features on the roadmap transform commons.id from a useful tool into a platform business.

First, **white-label convergence configuration** (Cycle 2, Sprint 21). Right now, ETHBoulder is hardcoded. By extracting convergence context into a configurable layer, any event organizer can stand up their own living archive. A hackathon in Berlin. A research symposium in Tokyo. A cooperative governance retreat in rural Vermont. Same infrastructure, different identity.

Second, the **communication layer** (Cycles 7-10). Channels, threads, and message resolution transform commons.id from a contribution tool into the coordination substrate for an entire event. When a thread resolves into an artifact in the knowledge graph, communication becomes knowledge creation. That is the product insight that differentiates us from every chat platform and every wiki.

Third, **convergence comparison** (Sprint 95). When multiple events use commons.id, organizers can see which themes recur, which participants bridge communities, which ideas evolve across gatherings. That cross-convergence intelligence is the network effect that makes the platform compound in value.

## The White-Label Opportunity

The "as-a-service" model is natural here. Every convergence event faces the same knowledge-loss problem. The seven-dimensional framework (e/H-LAM/T/S) is general enough to capture any domain while specific enough to provide real structure. The REA ontology (Resource, Event, Agent) maps cleanly to any gathering where people create things together.

What I am watching closely is the feedback from ETHBoulder participants this weekend. Their usage patterns will tell us which dimensions resonate, which contribution flows feel natural, and where the friction lives. That data shapes every prioritization decision through Cycle 4 and beyond.

The product roadmap runs 160 sprints in ebb-flow cycles -- optimize then build, optimize then build. That rhythm exists because shipping fast without hardening is how platforms fail. Every flow cycle adds capability. Every ebb cycle earns the trust that capability demands.

commons.id/app is not a product I am selling to ETHBoulder. It is a product ETHBoulder is teaching us how to build.
