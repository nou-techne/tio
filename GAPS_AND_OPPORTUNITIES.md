# TIO Gap Analysis & Strategic Evolution

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Context:** Review of Technology & Information Office (TIO) alignment with Techne/RegenHub core concepts.

## 1. The Ecological Gap ("The Ground")
**Observation:** Current roles (00-08) are modeled on high-competence software delivery teams (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Security).
**Gap:** Techne is grounded in *place* (1515 Walnut, Boulder Watershed) and *living systems*. There is no explicit bridge between the digital info-systems and the physical/ecological reality.
**Recommendation:**
- **New Role:** **Bio-Regional Data Steward**. Responsible for integrating environmental sensors, energy data (solar audit), and watershed context into the commons.id graph.
- **Enhancement:** Add "Ecological Impact" to the `06-compliance-security` mandate (not just legal compliance, but ecological accounting).

## 2. The Venture Gap ("The Garden")
**Observation:** We have built the *mechanics* for ventures (Royalties Engine, Cycle 4), but the *human coordination* of venture formation is implicit.
**Gap:** A Venture Studio needs more than just accounting for ventures; it needs incubation. Who helps a member turn an idea into a structured venture that uses the pattern library?
**Recommendation:**
- **New Role:** **Venture Architect / Pattern Librarian**. A role focused on composing the seven-layer stack for *new* ventures. Not just building the platform, but applying it.
- **Tooling:** Move "Pattern Library" from a static concept to an active TIO service.

## 3. The Economic Gap ("The Flow")
**Observation:** We have "Compliance & Security" (Defense) and "Patronage Engine" (Mechanics).
**Gap:** Who does the *Financial Engineering*? The design of the $CLOUD credit flows, the liquidity models, the pricing of the "Service Credits". This is currently assumed to be done by "The Committee" or Todd.
**Recommendation:**
- **New Role:** **Token Engineering & Economic Systems**. Modeling flows, simulating patronage weights, ensuring the internal economy ($CLOUD) remains solvent and circulatory.

## 4. The Cultural Gap ("The Scenius")
**Observation:** Role 08 (Writer) is a great start for education.
**Gap:** "Information" in TIO is treated largely as *data*. In a Scenius, information is *relationship*.
**Recommendation:**
- **Shift:** Rename "Information" to "Intelligence" or "Integration"?
- **Activity:** Explicit "Scenius Mapping" — not just participant linking, but active weaving of relationships.

## Summary of Proposed Evolution

| Current Role | Evolution / Expansion |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 00 Technical Lead | **System Steward**. Broader scope including ecological alignment. |
| 01 Schema Architect | **Pattern Keeper**. Curator of the 7-layer pattern library. |
| (New) | **09 Bio-Regional Steward**. Connection to place/energy/ecology. |
| (New) | **10 Venture Architect**. Incubation support & pattern application. |
| (New) | **11 Economic Engineer**. Flow modeling & tokenomics. |

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Define Role 09 (Bio-Regional Steward):** Align with the "Solar Audit" and "Quarterly/Seasonal" rhythm mentioned in roadmap.
2. **Operationalize the Pattern Library:** Move it from `MEMORY.md` theory to a TIO artifact repository that ventures can pull from.
3. **Rename TIO?** Consider "Office of Pattern & Flow" or "Ecological Information Office" to signal the shift.
